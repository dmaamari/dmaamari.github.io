              <br>
              I am Daniella, a Lebanese Canadian architect and urban designer. I am an energetic, hardworking, inquisitive, and ambitious person who upholds a delicate balance between creativity and practicality. I have lived in Canada, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, the Netherlands and the United States of America. I thrive under pressure, adapt fast to new environments, and value the cultural diversity that every experience brings.
  <br>
  <br>
  I have built my humble experience through a range of academic, curatorial, and practical projects in the built environment, such as MVRDV, Hashim Sarkis Studios, and Coup Architects.  I hold a Bachelor’s of Architecture (Lebanese American University 2017) and a Master’s of Science in Architecture Studies (Massachusetts Institute of Technology). My coursework at MIT comprised a balance of urban planning, Islamic architecture, art culture technology, and history of architecture courses.

          <h3>Teaching</h3>
            <p>At MIT, I had the wonderful opportunity to broaden my teaching portfolio by developing different courses through my research and teaching assistantships. With Dr. Azra Aksamija of the MIT Future Heritage Lab, I packaged a course on “Culturally Sensitive Design” in Al-Azraq Syrian refugee camp in Jordan for the “Dubai Institute of Design and Innovation”. I also revamped the syllabus and reading list of “Orientalism and Representation” to make it more suitable for undergraduate instruction. Additionally, under the supervision of Professor Nasser Rabbat, I designed a course titled “4.617 Urbicide: History of a Violent Practice” which is being offered for the third year in a row. </p>
            <p>I have always been interested in pursuing an academic career and view this teaching fellowship as the perfect opportunity and bridge between my master’s degree and a PhD in the near future. As such, I participated in the Kaufmann Teaching Certificate Program (KTCP) of the MIT Teaching and Learning Lab, which helped me refine my teaching skills and philosophy.</p><div/>
<br>
            <h3>Publications</h3>
              <p>My graduate thesis, “Reviving Cosmopolitan Beirut”, tracks the individuals and architecture of three art spaces, to argue that in the architecture and art they choose, there is a nostalgia towards the prewar cosmopolitan Beirut. I looked into why modernist buildings are the prime examples and containers of the image they are trying to resurrect, and how Ras Beirut is the perfect embodiment of this image. The modernist structures that were left untouched, are able to be “rescued” and can accommodate the art institutions seeking to exhibit more classical or traditional art forms like painting and sculpture.</p>
              <p>I am interested in the intersection of audiovisual material and the representation of architecture. I unpack films to shed light on the complex socio-political questions on the image of architecture, especially in contexts of urban conflict in the Arab World. I presented a paper I wrote in a History, Theory and Criticism seminar (Professor Lauren Jacobi) titled “Transgressing Borders through Taboo”, at TU Delft’s Faculty of Architecture and the Built Environment in a studio on borders and territories in conflict areas. This paper is under review and will be published as a book chapter in “Essay Films and Narrative Techniques” next fall. In November, I was a speaker in the “Mediated Activism” panel in the conference, “Mediating the Spatiality of Conflict”. The research paper I presented, “She is Beirut” was developed in Professor Ezra Glenn’s subject, “The City in Film” and tackled the importance of the preservation of film archives in the context of war-torn cities like Beirut. I was fortunate to be selected as one of the speakers whose papers will be published in TU Delft’s Theory Journal.

<h3>Projects</h3>
<p>I enjoy the attention to details that architecture brings and the holistic, large-scale problem-solving of urban planning. At Hashim Sarkis Studios, I prepared designs and models for three urban development projects in historic Byblos and led the construction team of the Chilean Architecture and Urbanism Biennial in setting up the exhibition “Byblos Blue”. At MVRDV, I participated in a rigorous urban study and publication on the city of Marseille in France, commissioned by the European Nomadic Biennale Manifesta13. </p>
<p>I am interested in community driven projects, especially ones grounded in real social and ecological problems. My practical experience equipped me with relevant urban planning competences like rigorous fieldwork, analysis, and civic engagement to create sustainable cities and communities.  I heightened my practical experiences with workshops and practicums such as a disaster risk management project in the Colombian Amazon and urban metabolism fieldwork in Morocco. The MIT Special Interest Group in Urban Settlements attended the United Nations World Urban Forum (UNWUF) placed me as workshop student leader and presented me with the chance to design an exhibit for school children at the UNWUF. </p>
<br>
<p>As an inquisitive person, I like to constantly challenge myself and expand my skillset. Partly due to the Covid-19 crisis, I am involved in several tech-related endeavors. I am currently working as a researcher for a start-up in Toronto (My2Tec) and as a designer for the MIT Lebanon Hackathon. I believe that I have a lot to learn still from the MIT community in general, but also a lot to contribute. I am interested in a many fields: history of architecture, historic preservation, urban planning, urban science and curatorial practices. I look forward to this opportunity as a chance to learn new things, meet exciting people, develop wonderful workshops, but most importantly pave the way for my career in academia.</p>
