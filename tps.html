            <h2>Teaching Philosophy Statement</h2>
            <p class="mb-0">
              <br>
              Throughout my academic journey, I encountered mentors who instilled in me a love for inquisitive research and investigation, pushing and encouraging me in my pursuits for higher education. To me, the role of the architect in the traditional sense, is obsolete. Rather, an education in architecture; one that teaches not only “the art of building”, but a general understanding of the principles of sociology, cultural studies, environmental systems, technology, and urban strategies in order to achieve a more site specific, efficient design, faithful to the needs and wishes of its end users is more in demand more than ever before.
              <br>
              I am primarily interested in teaching formative design studios and history/theory courses where students are introduced to basic architecture concepts that shape their views of architecture and the world around them. Notions of motion, space, and time are explored in relation to architecture and its representation in these foundational studios, which creates a wonderful link to my interest in bridging architecture practice and theory.
              <br>
I believe that architectural education is personal, interdisciplinary, and exciting. It is in constant flux, has the potential to be a truly wonderful learning experience and means of self-expression that connects the various interests that students may have. It is important to allow for creativity, productivity, and learning by creating an open, diverse, challenging, and positive environment.
              <br></p>

          <h4>Studio Space</h4>
            <p>My studio space is structured in a way to optimize cooperation, communication, and discussion which are vital ingredients for a coherent and exciting design process and methodology.
              <br>
                <h3>-Professional </h3>
              <p>I strive to be an approachable, accessible mentor who opens students’ eyes to new concepts and perspectives, but maintains a professional distance, necessary to exert pressure and allow students to produce the best work possible. </p>
              <br>

                    <h3>-Safe </h3>
                  <p>The attempt to create an inclusive teaching environment goes without saying. I try to be aware of the personal biases I may hold. I attend to the cognitive, behavioral, and emotional wellbeing of students in my classroom by fostering a culture that stimulates personal and collective growth by way of exposure to different ideas and projects, in an ambitious and challenging environment. </p><br>
                  <h3>-Positive </h3>
                <p>By acknowledging the pressure that comes with practical coursework and deliverables, I design schedules and assignments in a way to encourage reasonable working schedules and deadlines. I select reviewers and jury members who give constructive criticism to my students rather than ill-spirited reviews, to ensure a nontoxic, positive learning environment. </p><br>


            <h4>Practice</h4>
              <h3>-Tailoring Projects to Individual Interests</h3>
              <p>My teaching methods rely heavily on visual material, such as the juxtaposition of controversial images, references of popular culture and daily life to illicit interesting responses and discussions. I depend on research, site-specific analysis, and narrative storytelling to produce collages of exciting architectural moments. I am interested in the intersection between architecture and film (or other visual arts) and recognize the strength of architecture as a discipline that connects to various other disciplines.
                <br>
I value interdisciplinary and individuality in projects and encourage students to tailor their studio projects to their individual interests by asking them to keep a stream of consciousness journal where they identify possible references, starting points or thoughts that feed into their architectural projects.

  <h3>-Designing from the Inside, Out</h3>
<p>Architectural design is a personal process. Throughout the course, I show my students my process of work and encourage them to use it. My design process begins with the interior spaces, growing out naturally as a result of the design methodology and physical model-making, without much regard to exterior aesthetic preferences.
</p>
<br>

<h3>-Teaming Up</h3>
<p>Although it is often unfavorable for students to work on group design projects, I believe it is crucial to have at least one group exercise, preferably in the beginning of the semester. The collaborative and vibrant aspect of the classroom creates a sense of community by fostering students’ sense of belonging and serves as a realistic model for the different types of design collaborations they will face in the real world. Another aspect I hope to employ is the Critical Friend or Peer Pin-Ups/Reviews, where students choose another person to help them criticize their work in a friendly, tight context. It would be interesting to provide students with a rubric or checklist of relevant topics and criteria upon which they can base their constructive criticism and explain it to the teacher.</p>

<h3>-Learning On-Site</h3>
<p>What better way to learn about something than to immerse yourself in it? Literally! Although these trips may be logistically difficult at times, I believe that being immersed in a new context is crucial to the development of site-specific solutions and learning processes. In my design teaching methodology, the site is a source of design inspiration through critical analysis and understanding. <br>
<h3>-Creating Impact</h3>
<p>As a design studio professor, I empower students to recognize the impact that architecture can effect on their built environment, I help them design or build something they are proud of, a personal and fun design that they are proud to include in their portfolios. Through various assignments, I motivate students to participate in local NGO work such as cultural heritage preservation endeavors and refugee camps, to name a few, as a way to shed light on the link between architecture, sociology and politics.<br>
