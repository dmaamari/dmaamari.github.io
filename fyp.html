<h3>Investigation</h3>
                <p>“Reinterpretation of the Grand Hotel Kassouf” is a project dealing with the
collective memory of an edifice, the Grand Hotel Kassouf (GHK); a monument
in the eyes of a notable Levantine town, Dhour Choueir. The GHK is an archetype
in the assemblage of hotels that rose in Mount Lebanon prior to the
onset of the Civil War; an ode to the increasing phenomenon of seasonal
migration as chief generator of income in Lebanon.
The hotel is a product of the development of tourism in Dhour Choueir, motivated
by a courteous relation with Ottoman rulers who chose the town as the
seat of several regional conventions and expos (Ottoman Expo in 1904/5).
Dhour Choueir, with its myriad of novel hotels, housed countless festivals,
beauty pageants, concerts and conventions, all through the Golden Age of
Lebanon (1930s to 1960s); a Lebanon hosting people from across the region
on behalf of its climate, location, and cultural significance as summer residence
of various poets, musicians, and dignitaries.

                        <br>The GHK is one of many
                        hotels culminating all that is entertainment, luxury, bourgeois, and grandeur
                        within one space. Unfortunately, its prime location proved detrimental when
                        the Syrian military (1980’s to 2005) invaded and utilized its grounds as a military
                        base during their occupation of Mount Lebanon.
                        The hotel now stands as witness to unwarranted pillaging and destruction; a
                        ruin of the Golden Age of Lebanon, open to contemporary programmatic
                        invasions (photoshoots, film screenings, coffee shops, beauty pageants…). It
                        was recently acquired by former Minister Elias Bou Saab and the former
                        mayor of Dhour Choueir Mr. Elias Sawaya. The pair plan to refurbish the edifice, expanding its footprint substantially.<br>
                        <br>
                        <h3>Implementation</h3>
                        <br>
                        Collection and classification of archival documentation included a rigorous
search in the folios of Shweir Community Library, personal historical collections,
“Cinémathèque du Liban” of Lebanon’s Ministry of Culture, TV stations
like TéléLiban, the Arab Image Foundation, newspapers and books, to name a
few. “Jeunesse au Soleil/ Shabab Taht Al-Shams "a Lebanese film directed by
Samir Nasri in 1966, recorded almost entirely in and around the GHK, provided
insight into the features of the building’s earlier- currently glorified- conditions.
Through a process of mapping out the different characters, movements,
events, light & space qualities on the architectural plans and elevations
of the GHK, it was possible to recognize the portions of the building
depicted in the film. Upon juxtaposing the drawings on the current context of
destroyed walls, the spaces are reconfigured, acquiring different spaces, formerly
disconnected or not visible.

<br>Even within the film itself, spaces in the movie are altered and shifted; positioned
in a manner evoking a certain architectural truth that is, in fact, not
visually or technically possible. These were designated as the visual impossibilities,
represented as the “blue moments” for diagrammatic simplicity. The
editing process of the movie produced cuts, designated as “pink moments”,
representing a certain function, circulation element, or simply a dissimilar
type of spatial arrangement, in conjunction with the instantaneous conditions
and events of the unfolding storyline. The formed associations allowed
for a sequential experience of pink and blue moments that guides one
through the film from one space to another.<br>

              <p>To maintain a subtle intervention that does not overshadow the GHK, the
project is introduced in the valley facing it. Only a steel bridge remains above
road level, drawing visitors into its various functions; the rest of the intervention
is embedded below within the conserved pine trees. The scheme sustains
the programs delineated within the film and archival documentation as
well as functions that respond to present- day needs and predict those that
may arise in the near future: casino, dining halls, hotel rooms, theater… The
project is thus an attempt at the reinterpretation of a space, through an analysis
of attainable archival documentation, by one individual. It provides one
scheme in the handling of monuments by drawing on existing archival material; one
scheme in the endless debate on the collective memory, destruction and reconstruction
of monuments.<br>
